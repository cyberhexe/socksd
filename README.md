MicroSocks - multithreaded, small, efficient SOCKS5 server.
===========================================================

A SOCKS5 service that you can run on your remote boxes to tunnel connections
through them, if for some reason SSH doesn't cut it for you.

It's very lightweight, and very light on resources too.
